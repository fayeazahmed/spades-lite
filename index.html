		Pure vanilla javascript Spades card game. Well, not as intelligent as it sounds though :3<br>
		2 major things that I didn't attempt to implement considering it might take too long-
		There is no beginning call/bidding. You just keep on playing until you want and the points keeps getting
		added. Didn't bother including any "finish game" feature as well, just close the tab :v
		And next thing is the other players (cpu) do not consider the cards that previously been played
		in current round while playing a card. It selects the best card that can be played in this bid ( if there's
		no higher card of leading suit, or a trump is already in play, then don't select a high card and some
		things like that). The icon of clubs suit is different cause that is the most similar thing I could find in
		fontawesome.<br>
		It's not the best app to play Spades, but I definitely learnt a lot and did most problem solving making
		this.
